\usage{
corMatrix(
  condition1 = NULL,
  condition2 = NULL,
  method = c("Diff", "Perc.Change"),
  treat = NULL,
  temp = NULL,
  enviro = NULL,
  sex = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{condition1}{A string specifying a condition within one of the experimental variables. The difference is calculated as: \code{condition1}-\code{condition2}}

\item{condition2}{A string specifying a condition within the same experimental variable as \code{condition1} that is associated with the difference seen in sleep.}

\item{method}{method is an argument for which calculation to use (Diff or Perc.Change). Diff computes \code{condition1}-\code{condition2}; Perc.Change computes (\code{condition1}-\code{condition2}) / \code{condition2}.}

\item{treat}{A string specifying a Treatment to subset the data by.}

\item{temp}{A string specifying a Temperature condition to subset the data by.}

\item{enviro}{A string specifying a Environment condition to subset the data by.}

\item{sex}{A string specifying a sex condition to subset the data by.}

\item{lights}{A string specifying a Light condition to subset the data by.}

\item{geno}{A string specifying a Genotype condition to subset the data by.}

\item{formula}{Independent variables & their interactions in predicting sleep.The specified formula is used in fitting a linear model to the data}

\item{font}{A character string determining the font style of the produced plots. ("plain", "bold", "italic", or "bold.italic"). Default is "plain"}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}. The function's primary output is saved to the working directory: a PDF file containing the correlation plot and a CSV file with the FDR-adjusted correlation p-values.
}
\description{
Computes the relative sleep changes between two Treatments and generates a correlation matrix plot with significance annotations.
}
\details{
The function reads data, optionally fits a linear model, and computes the correlation and FDR-adjusted p-values for the final sleep metrics. A single ggplot object (the correlation matrix plot with significance annotations) is saved as a PDF file, and the correlation p-values are saved as a CSV.
Note: If 'Batch' is in your model, fix it at the first level to ensure a consistent baseline
