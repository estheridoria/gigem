\arguments{
\item{x}{The name of a categorical variable (e.g., "Genotype", "Treatment") to be used as the x-axis for ranking and plotting.}

\item{control}{The name of the control condition within the variable 'x'. If specified, a side-by-side comparison plot is generated showing the control's data broken down by Batch for context (only applicable when not using fitted values).}

\item{condition1}{A string specifying the condition used as the reference/numerator (e.g., "Iso") when calculating difference or percent change. Default is NULL.}

\item{condition2}{A string specifying the condition used as the comparison/denominator (e.g., "Grp") for difference or percent change. Default is NULL.}

\item{method}{The calculation method to use when 'condition1' and 'condition2' are specified. Must be "Diff" (calculates \code{condition1} - \code{condition2}) or "Perc.Change" (calculates (\code{condition1} - \code{condition2}) / \code{condition2}).}

\item{treat}{A string specifying a Treatment to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{temp}{A string specifying a Temperature condition to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{enviro}{A string specifying a Environment condition to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{sex}{A string specifying a sex condition to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{lights}{A string specifying a Light condition to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{geno}{A string specifying a Genotype condition to subset the data by. Default is NULL.}

\item{ranking}{A vector of strings specifying the custom order of conditions for the x-axis. If NULL (default), the order is determined by the mean of the Total Sleep metric.}

\item{formula}{Independent variables & their interactions in predicting sleep. If non-NULL, predicted values (fitted values) from the LM are used instead of raw means.}

\item{font}{A character string determining the font style of the produced plots. ("plain", "bold", "italic", or "bold.italic"). Default is "plain".}
}
\value{
A vector of strings containing the final, calculated ranking (order) of conditions from the 'x' variable. Saves the plots as a PDF file labeled \code{RankedSleep...}.
}
\description{
This function generates ranked bar plots to visualize changes or absolute values of sleep metrics (Total, Day, Night).
It reads the aggregated sleep data from \code{all_batches_summary.csv}, calculates the difference or percent change
between two conditions if specified, and can optionally use fitted values derived from a linear model (LM)
to control for nuisance variables. The plots are generated for each of the three sleep metrics.
}
\details{
The primary output is a set of bar plots where the x-axis is ranked based on the Total Sleep metric (or Total Sleep Difference/Change).
The data is summarized at the population mean level before plotting.
