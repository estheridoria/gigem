\title{Perform K-Means Clustering on Sleep Data}
\usage{
kmeansCluster(Compare1, Compare2, groupings, column_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{Compare1}{A string specifying the first comparison treatment group (e.g., "Control").}

\item{Compare2}{A string specifying the second comparison treatment group (e.g., "Treatment").}

\item{groupings}{A character vector of group names (e.g., c("L1", "L2", "S1", "S2", "CS")) to match against the specified column (default is \code{genotype}).}

\item{column_name}{A string specifying the column name for grouping in the data (default is \code{genotype}).}

\item{combined_data}{A \code{data.frame} containing summarized data, with columns for genotype, sleep time, and other factors.}
}
\value{
None. Saves the plots as PDF files and outputs a CSV file with cluster assignments.
}
\description{
This function reads in a CSV file (\code{all_batches_summary.csv}) containing summarized data, performs K-means clustering to identify optimal clusters based on the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Gap Statistic, and creates plots of sleep trends with clustering information.
The user can provide a list of groupings (e.g., genotype categories) and add them dynamically to the dataset.
}
\details{
This function performs K-means clustering on sleep data for two comparison treatment groups (\code{Compare1} and \code{Compare2}). It automatically determines the optimal number of clusters using three methods:
\itemize{
\item Elbow Method
\item Silhouette Score
\item Gap Statistic
The function generates and saves a series of plots showing the sleep trends, with points colored by cluster assignment and pregrouping information.
The clustering results are saved in a CSV file.
