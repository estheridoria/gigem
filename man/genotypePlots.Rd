\title{Generate Combined Genotype Plots (Internal)}
\usage{
genotypePlots(dt_curated_final, summary_dt_final)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_curated_final}{A \code{data.table} containing curated sleep data with columns such as \code{id} and \code{asleep}.}

\item{summary_dt_final}{A \code{data.table} containing summary statistics with columns including \code{light}, \code{environment},
\code{genotype}, \code{treatment}, and various sleep metrics.}
}
\value{
None. Plots are saved as PDF files.
}
\description{
Creates combined plots for each unique combination of \code{light}, \code{environment}, and \code{genotype} in the dataset.
Generates overlay sleep plots and sleep duration plots, saving each combination as a PDF file.
}
\details{
The function iterates through all unique combinations of \code{light}, \code{environment}, and \code{genotype}.
For each combination:
\itemize{
\item An overlay sleep plot is created using \code{ggetho}.
\item Multiple sleep duration plots (e.g., total sleep, daytime sleep, nighttime sleep) are generated
using a helper function, \code{create_sleeptime_plot}.
\item Plots are combined into a single figure using \code{cowplot::plot_grid}.
\item The combined figure is saved as a PDF file, with the filename reflecting the combination of \code{light},
\code{environment}, and \code{genotype}.
}

The function dynamically adjusts plot widths based on the number of unique treatments in the dataset.
